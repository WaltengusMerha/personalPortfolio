          <h3>Website<span>Learner</span></h3>
          <p>I was born in 1994 EC. When I was 7 years old, I registered  at Lumame Primary School. After completing my primary education, I continued to study at Gnbot 20 Secondary and Preparatory School. Following the completion of secondary school, I joined Bahirdar University, where I have been studying Information Systems ever since.</p>
          <p> Before joining Bahir Dar University, I had no background in website development. However, after joining the  university, I learned some computer languages and gained information about website development. Now, I am passionate about becoming a full-stack developer. Currently, I am trying to learn website development on my own by utilizing YouTube videos and other related resources. </p>
